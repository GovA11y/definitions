  content: Support the callout with some short explanatory text. You don't need more than a couple of sentences.

tagline: Click the nav bar and such.
intro: |
  I added some pages and such to the nav bar. All these files are machine readable

  I put some placeholder stuff there, but we can define it however you want. Now that I have it in a machine readable format, things are peachy. Definitions are managed in a csv file, so you add a n item to it and it is prettified.

  Not sure if a table is the best way to show this data, let me know what you think about the other USWDS thingies.

## Section heading

{:.font-heading-xl.margin-y-0"}

Use this section to encourage them to act. Describe why they should get in touch here, and use an active verb on the button below. “Get in touch,” “Learn more,” and so on.
