## A11yScore

The [A11yScore](/a11yrithms/a11yscore) is a sophisticated tool that evaluates the accessibility of a set of URLs under a specific domain. By considering various severity levels of both violations and passes, the algorithm offers a composite score that reflects the accessibility status of the analyzed URLs. While excelling in identifying and weighting accessibility issues based on their severity and frequency, the score's accuracy and utility may depend on the quality and characteristics of the input data. It's important to note that this score may not entirely capture the user experience of individuals with disabilities.
