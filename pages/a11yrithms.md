A11yRithms is a curated collection of sophisticated algorithms designed to power the GovA11y ecosystem and a variety of accessibility tools. By integrating key considerations like accessibility violations, passes, and their respective severity levels, these algorithms offer comprehensive and nuanced analyses of web content. Each algorithm in the A11yRithms suite serves a unique purpose, working together to provide a broad spectrum of insights for improving web accessibility. Whether it's scoring a domain's accessibility status or pinpointing specific areas for improvement, A11yRithms forms the backbone of GovA11y's commitment to creating a more accessible web experience for all users.

## A11yScore

The [A11yScore](/a11yrithms/a11yscore) is a sophisticated tool that evaluates the accessibility of a set of URLs under a specific domain. By considering various severity levels of both violations and passes, the algorithm offers a composite score that reflects the accessibility status of the analyzed URLs. While excelling in identifying and weighting accessibility issues based on their severity and frequency, the score's accuracy and utility may depend on the quality and characteristics of the input data. It's important to note that this score may not entirely capture the user experience of individuals with disabilities.
